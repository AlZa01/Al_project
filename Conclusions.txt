abc.py
The script sorts three integer variables (a, b, c) in ascending order using three simple 'if' statements. The idea was to repeatedly compare and swap the values of variables, ensuring that after each comparison, the smallest value is placed in a, the next smallest in b, and the biggest in c. This shows us the power of basic conditional statements in sorting small sets of data. While more complex sorting algorithms exist, the simple approach using 'if' statements provides a foundational understanding of sorting principles and conditional logic in programming. 

counter.py
The script identifies and counts the number of string elements within a list containing elements of various data types. The 'for' loop is used to iterate through each element in the list, and the condition statement checks if each element is of type str (string). The counter in this task provides the total count of string elements in the list. This simple exercise shows us the importance of data type identification in python, a fundamental skill for working with data. With this knowledge we are allowed to perform specific operations tailored to each type of data. Checking data types also helps us avoid unexpected errors (for example, when working with user input or data from external sources).
